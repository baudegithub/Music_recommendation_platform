# Music_recommendation_platform
This project shows my ability to use  machine learning techniques to build a music recommendation platform 

                                   Marchine learning Project

**Overview of the Project**
 We suppose a  music streaming  company wants to improve  the experience of the users of  its  music  streaming plateform
 
**Task of the data scientist**
As a data scientist , My job is to use the provided data set to build a strong, accurate  and reliable  machine  Learning    model in  order to help the company reach  its goal.

**Tools and  programming language** 
 In this project we are creating a   supervised machine learning model ( using jupyter note book) that will make suggestion for users of the  music streaming plateform.
Data set
This project uses a made up labelled  data set (  containing  some clear paterns that the model can learn from to make good predicton)  which contains the age , the gender and the music genre of  18 users (  both women and men).

The results of the predictions
